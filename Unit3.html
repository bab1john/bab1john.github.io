  <h1>"Climate Action" Project</h1>
  <h2>In this python project I learned more about 13th global goal "Climate Action", and made a simple game about it. It's a simple clicker where you should gain cash and by some improvements to make world clearer. This game shows the safe ways to gain energy and electricity without polluting environment.</h2>
